  <h1>Why does this blog exist?</h1>

  <b>24.05.2025</b>

  <p>
    Recently, I was kind of frustrated with my lack of knowledge about networking. We used sockets in C at university,
    but I definitely had some knowledge gaps. Also, even though I've designed a good amount of websites in the past, the
    HTML protocol has always just been a blackbox for me. For this reason, I decided to write my own HTTP server.
  </p>

  <h2>Choosing a language</h2>

  <p>
    I feel like most people would immediately go for C when writing something from scratch. While this is a reasonable
    choice, I've personally never really liked C. Not because I'm scawed of manual memowy management :( but rather
    because the language just feels kind of... clumsy?
  </p>

  <p>
    Even doing something as simple as getting command line arguments is really annoying (all my homies hate getopt).
    Error handling is awkward (does a return value of -1 mean failure? or 0?), enums are pretty meh, the entire
    toolchain sucks (I don't wanna learn make...).
  </p>

  <p>
    Fortunately, there are a lof of other options nowadays. Zig and Rust are probably the two most popular. I'm
    actually very well versed with C++. However, I recently moved away from it after having a crashout over CMake (why
    yes I would love to write 2000 lines of this stupid ass language just to run my program!!!). So, which one did I
    choose? Zig or Rust?
  </p>

  <p>
    Well, I've never tried Zig but it looks pretty nice. I've done a bit of Rust in the past but I think it's pretty
    overkill for hobby projects (and projects that use the GPU a lot, as most errors will happen there anyway. So why
    spend so much energy getting the CPU side of the project 99.9% safe?). There is one other language however which
    I've recently come to love. After being frustrated with C++, I looked around for alternatives. And one language in
    particular stuck out to me:<br>
    <b>Odin</b>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Not many people have heard of odin, but it's by far the best language I've ever used. It's basically like C but...
    not horrible to use. It has some extremely useful language features, like the implicit context. The context is a
    special struct that is implicitly passed to each function (or procedure as they're called in odin). This happens as
    part of odin's own calling convention. The context object contains information like an allocator or logger (there's
    also a user_ptr field where you can put your own data, but I don't use it that much). Most functions that allocate
    memory will use the context.allocator (unless specified otherwise). I love using this feature for setting up a
    tracking allocator:

    <span class="var">tracking_allocator</span>: <span class="type">mem.Tracking_Allocator</span>
    <span class="func">mem.tracking_allocator_init</span>(&<span class="var">tracking_allocator</span>, <span class="var">context.allocator</span>)
    <span class="var">context.allocator</span> = <span class="func">mem.tracking_allocator</span>(&<span class="var">tracking_allocator</span>)

    <span class="kw">defer</span> {
      <span class="kw">for</span> _, <span class="var">entry</span> <span class="kw">in</span> <span class="var">tracking_allocator.allocation_map</span> {
        <span class="func">log.warnf</span>(<span class="str">"%v leaked %d bytes"</span>, <span class="var">entry.location</span>, <span class="var">entry.size</span>)
      }

      <span class="kw">for</span> <span class="var">entry</span> <span class="kw">in</span> <span class="var">tracking_allocator.bad_free_array</span> {
        <span class="func">log.warnf</span>(<span class="str">"%v bad free on %v"</span>, <span class="var">entry.location</span>, <span class="var">entry.memory</span>)
      }

      <span class="func">mem.tracking_allocator_destroy</span>(&<span class="var">tracking_allocator</span>)
    }
  }
  </pre>
  <!-- noformat -->

  <p>
    This code checks whether we're in debug mode and if so, it will create a tracking allocator (basically has an
    allocation map and a free array to make sure you don't leak memory or double free). The defer keyword makes the
    scope run at the end of the main function. Since we set the context.allocator and most of the code I wrote just
    defaults to using it, this is an extremely useful tool to check whether I made any mistaked (which I never do ofc
    ;)).

  <h2>The core:net library</h2>

  <p>
    When someone says that they're writing something from scratch that's usually a lie. To truly make something from
    scratch, you'd probably have to write it in assembly. The level of abstraction that I chose are C-like sockets. I'm
    obviously not using C, but the odin standard library has a very similiar interface. For example, this is how you
    listen on a TCP socket:
  </p>

  <br>

  <!-- noformat -->
  <pre>
    <span class="var">listen_endpoint</span> := <span class="type">net.Endpoint</span> {
      <span class="var">address</span> = <span class="type">net.IP4_Address</span>{<span class="num">127</span>, <span class="num">0</span>, <span class="num">0</span>, <span class="num">1</span>},
      <span class="var">port</span>    = <span class="num">8080</span>,
    }

    <span class="func">net.bind</span>(<span class="var">tcp_socket</span>, <span class="var">listen_endpoint</span>)

    <span class="var">listen_socket</span>, <span class="var">listen_err</span> := <span class="func">net.listen_tcp</span>(<span class="var">listen_endpoint</span>)
    <span class="kw">if</span> <span class="var">listen_err</span> != <span class="kw">nil</span> {
      <span class="func">log.errorf</span>(<span class="str">"Failed to put the socket into the listening state (err: %v)"</span>, <span class="var">listen_err</span>)
      <span class="kw">return</span>
    }
  </pre>
  <!-- noformat -->

  <p>
    This should be very familiar for C devs. All the data that you receive from the socket is stored in a []u8 (that's a
    slice of u8's).
  </p>

  <h2>HTTP/1.1 is easier than I thought</h2>

  <p>
    Pretty quickly, my uncertainty about HTTP disappeared. Building a simple HTTP/1.1 server is extremely simple. For
    this project, I actually went for a very simple implementation. It's not a general purpose backend like Flask since
    I chose to keep it very specific to my purpose. This allows me to take some nice shortcuts like hardcoding most the
    response headers (except for the mime type f.e.). If you check the response headers for this html file, you'll see
    the 6 headers that I set.
  </p>

  <p>
    The way the server fetches resources is kept very simple. Everything has to come from the content/ folder. Every
    uri has to consist of two parts: /folder/file.extension. The folder has to match the extension: .css files have to
    be in the styles folder, .png in the images folder, etc. If they match, the server will look for them in at
    content/folder/file.extension. I didn't see a reason why I should make it more general, as that will open me up to
    more vulnerabilities like CSRF.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>

  <p>
    In my opinion, implemeting something from scratch is a great learning experience. No matter how much you study
    something in theory, writing the code out yourself gives you a level of understanding that is not attainable
    otherwise. So if there's ever something you're really interested in but struggle to understand, just give writing it
    from scratch a shot. It doesn't matter if no one ends up using it - it's all about the friends we made along the
    way. Or the knowledge we gained? idk
